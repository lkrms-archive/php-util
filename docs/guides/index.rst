``main`` branch of the projectâ€™s `GitHub repository`_ and is generated by
`phpDocumentor`_.

If phpDocumentor is installed on your system, you can build the API
documentation by running ``phpdoc`` in the top-level directory. It should appear
in ``docs/api`` after a few seconds.

Other documentation is available in the source code.
